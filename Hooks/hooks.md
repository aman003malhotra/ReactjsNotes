## React Hooks
- React hooks are special functions that can only be used in functional component (and custom hooks).
- These functions add extra capabilities to functional components


## Functional Components
- Historically limited to outputting content.
- Were not able to change internal state.

## Class Based Components
- Could contain and manage state.
- More overhead code(compared to functional component)
